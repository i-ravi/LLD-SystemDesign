# State Design Pattern

The State Design Pattern enables an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes. It achieves this by encapsulating state-specific behavior into separate classes. This pattern is useful for managing complex state transitions and promotes code modularity and flexibility. Common applications include finite state machines, workflow management systems, game development, and network protocol implementations.

Applications:
- Traffic Light Control System: In a traffic light system, the behavior of the traffic lights changes based on the current state of traffic (e.g., green for "go," yellow for "prepare to stop," and red for "stop"). The State Pattern can manage these state transitions efficiently.
- Document Editing Software: Document editing software often has different states such as editing, saving, and printing. The State Pattern can be used to manage transitions between these states and handle user interactions accordingly.
- Vending Machine: Vending machines have different states based on their availability of products, current balance, and whether they are dispensing products. The State Pattern can model these states and manage transitions between them.
- Game Character Behavior: In video games, characters may have different behaviors based on their current state (e.g., attacking, defending, or idle). The State Pattern can be used to manage these behaviors and switch between them dynamically.
- User Authentication System: A user authentication system may have states such as logged in, logged out, or locked out. The State Pattern can handle these states and manage user interactions accordingly, such as allowing access to certain features only when logged in.


There could be more such examples for this pattern. ðŸš€
