# Builder Design Pattern
The Builder Design Pattern separates the construction of complex objects from their representation. It involves a builder interface or abstract class defining construction steps, concrete builders implementing those steps, a director orchestrating the process, and the product being constructed. This pattern is useful for creating objects with many optional parameters, allowing for flexible and clear construction logic.

Applications:
- Complex Object Creation: When an object requires multiple steps or parameters to be set during its construction, especially when some parameters are optional or have default values.
- Flexible Object Creation: When you want to create objects with different configurations without exposing the construction logic to the client code.
- Immutable Objects: When you need to create immutable objects where once constructed, the object cannot be modified, and every construction step creates a new instance.
- Testing: It facilitates testing by providing clear separation between the construction steps and the object's creation, allowing for easier mocking and testing of the construction process.
- Encapsulation of Construction Logic: When you want to encapsulate the construction logic within a separate class hierarchy, making the code easier to maintain and understand.
- Variability in Object Representation: When there are multiple ways to represent a complex object, and you want to decouple the construction process from the representation.
