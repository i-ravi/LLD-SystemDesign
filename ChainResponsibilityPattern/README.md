# Chain Responsibility Pattern
The Chain of Responsibility design pattern allows an object to pass a request along a chain of handlers until it's handled by one of them. Each handler decides either to process the request or pass it to the next handler in the chain. This pattern promotes loose coupling between senders and receivers of a request, as any handler can handle the request without knowing the full chain.

Applications:
- Middleware Processing: In web frameworks, middleware components form a chain to handle HTTP requests, where each middleware can process, modify, or pass the request to the next middleware.
- Event Handling: UI frameworks use a chain of responsibility pattern to propagate events through a hierarchy of event handlers until they're handled by the appropriate component.
- Logging and Error Handling: Logging frameworks and error handling systems utilize chains of responsibility to handle log messages or errors at various levels of severity or abstraction.
- Authorization and Authentication: Security systems employ chains of responsibility to handle authorization and authentication requests, with each handler verifying different aspects of the request.
- Workflow Processing: Workflow engines define sequences of steps as chains of responsibility to process workflows, with each step performing specific tasks or validations before passing control to the next step.
