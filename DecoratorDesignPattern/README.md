## Decorator Design Pattern

The decorator design pattern is a structural pattern that allows adding behavior to individual objects dynamically without affecting other objects from the same class.

Applications:
- UI Frameworks: Adding features like borders, scroll bars, or shadows to UI components dynamically.
- Logging: Wrapping functions to add logging before and after function calls.
- Authorization: Adding security checks to functions or methods to ensure proper user permissions.
- Caching: Storing the results of expensive function calls to improve performance.
- Data Validation: Adding validation logic to input fields in forms.
- Notifications: Sending alerts or notifications when certain events occur in an application.
