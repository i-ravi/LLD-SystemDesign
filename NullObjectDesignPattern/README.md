## Null Object Design Pattern
The Null Object design pattern provides an alternative to using null references in code by introducing a Null Object that represents a neutral or "do nothing" behavior. This pattern helps to avoid null pointer exceptions and simplifies code by ensuring that objects always have a defined behavior, even in cases where they would traditionally be null. It's particularly useful in scenarios where null checks are common, such as handling optional or absent values, and can improve code readability and maintainability by promoting consistent behavior across objects.

Applications:
- Default Configurations: Providing default settings in configuration systems when specific configurations are missing.
- Optional Dependencies: Offering optional dependencies in dependency injection frameworks without requiring explicit null checks.
- Empty Collections: Representing empty collections or streams in data processing pipelines or algorithms.
- Error Handling: Returning Null Objects instead of throwing exceptions for graceful error handling.
- Fallback Mechanisms: Using Null Objects as fallbacks for disabled or unavailable features in feature toggling frameworks.
