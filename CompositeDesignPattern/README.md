# Composite Design Pattern

The Composite Design Pattern allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It provides a unified interface for both individual objects and compositions of objects, simplifying client code and enabling the manipulation of complex structures uniformly. Applications include GUI components, file system structures, organization hierarchies, and document structures.

Applications: 
- Graphic User Interfaces (GUI): It's commonly used to represent complex GUI elements like windows, panels, and buttons, where individual elements and their compositions need to be treated uniformly.
- File Systems: It can represent directories and files in a file system, where directories can contain other directories or files, allowing for unified operations on the entire file system structure.
- Organization Structures: It's suitable for modeling organizational hierarchies, where departments can contain sub-departments and employees, enabling consistent handling of different organizational units.
- Document Structures: It's applicable in text processing applications to represent document structures, where documents can contain sections, paragraphs, and other nested elements, facilitating consistent processing of document components.
- Composite Graphics: It's used in computer graphics to represent complex shapes composed of simpler shapes, where transformations or operations can be applied uniformly to the entire composite structure.
