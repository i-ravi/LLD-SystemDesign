# Adapter Design Pattern

The Adapter Design Pattern allows classes with incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between the client and the adaptee, converting the adaptee's interface into one that the client expects. This promotes code reusability, modular codebase, and easier testing and maintenance.

Applications:
- Integration with legacy code: When incorporating new functionality into existing systems that use outdated interfaces, adapters can bridge the gap between the old and new systems.
- Third-party libraries: Adapters can be used to make third-party libraries compatible with your codebase, allowing you to leverage their functionality without having to modify your existing code.
- Implementing interfaces: Adapters can be used to implement multiple interfaces in a single class, providing flexibility and avoiding the need for multiple inheritance.
- Mocking and testing: Adapters can be used in testing to simulate the behavior of objects with different interfaces, making it easier to test components in isolation.
- Language interoperability: In multi-language environments, adapters can facilitate communication between components written in different programming languages by translating method calls and data formats.
